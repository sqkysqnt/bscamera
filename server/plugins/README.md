Issues:

whisper and vosk do not work to any reasonable degree, yet.

x32 pulls straight from the console. 

mixingstation does the same thing as x32 but polls mixingstation's api instead of the console.

Test plugin is good. No issues with it.

qlab_bridge creates an OSC receiver and filters qlab and ETC EOS messages in order to create a transparent overlay page (i.e. to place on top of a video show feed)
